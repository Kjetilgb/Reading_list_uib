# Reading list UiB

A small project working with UiBs API. With this API you are able to retrieve all available courses on UiB for a given semester.

You can check out the working project on [my site](https://folk.uib.no/zib007/)

This API requires you to have an API key. If you want to try the project out yourself you can [get a key by generating one from this link.](https://dataapi.app.uib.no/?lang=en)
