# Reading list UiB

A small project working with UiBs API. With this API you are able to retrieve all available courses on UiB for a given semester with some information about them. 
Some courses are more clear on providing a reading list, while som are not. 

I therefore started this little project so I could find the reading list for my courses easier.

This project requires you to have an API key. If you want to try the project out yourself you can [get a key by generating one from this link.](https://dataapi.app.uib.no/?lang=en)
